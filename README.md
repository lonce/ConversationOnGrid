This code runs a differential equation solver.
Currently the equation consists of 2 couples Lotka-Volterra (predetor/prey) models.

NOTE: This program uses CSS Grid Layout, which requires that 
   a) you use Chrome,
   b) you set a flag

We use the numveri.js library for the solver:
http://www.numericjs.com/

We use the raphaelljs library for graphics:
http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/

and require.js for module loading

All the libraries are included locally.
